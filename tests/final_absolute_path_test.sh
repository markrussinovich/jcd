echo "=== Key Changes Made ==="
echo "1. Rust binary (src/main.rs):"
echo "   - Changed absolute path logic to use search_down_breadth_first_all()"
echo "   - Removed limitation of max_depth=3 for absolute patterns"
echo "   - Now uses max_depth=8 like relative patterns"
echo
echo "2. Shell completion (jcd_function.sh):"
echo "   - Updated _jcd_get_absolute_matches() to use jcd binary directly"
echo "   - Ensures shell completion has same behavior as binary"
echo "   - Removed custom glob-based absolute path logic"
echo

echo "=== Result ==="
echo "✓ Absolute patterns like '/4' now do comprehensive deep search"
echo "✓ Consistent behavior between 'pattern' and '/pattern'"
echo "✓ Shell completion uses same logic as main binary"
echo "✓ Maintains all existing functionality"
